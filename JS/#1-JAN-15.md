# Answers :

## Section A: Output-Based Questions (Medium to Advanced)

1. **Answer: A) `5`**
   - Explanation: The statement `var a = b = 5;` is interpreted as `b = 5;` (global variable) and `var a = 5;` (local variable within the function). Therefore, `b` is accessible globally.

2. **Answer: B) `20` and `20`**
   - Explanation: The `x` variable is updated inside the IIFE, and since `x` is globally scoped, its value will be `20` after the IIFE execution. The returned value from the IIFE is also `20`.

3. **Answer: B) `NaN`**
   - Explanation: The function `func` loses the correct `this` context when called outside the object. As a result, `this.a` is `undefined`, and `undefined + 1` results in `NaN`.

4. **Answer: B) `3 3 3`**
   - Explanation: The `setTimeout` callback is executed after 1000ms. By that time, the loop has completed, and `i` equals `3`. This is logged three times.

5. **Answer: B) `false`**
   - Explanation: Arrays are reference types in JavaScript, and when compared using `==`, two arrays with the same values are not considered equal because they are different references.

## Section B: Core JavaScript Multiple Choice Questions

6. **Answer: A) Variables declared with `let` are hoisted to the top of their scope.**
   - Explanation: Variables declared with `let` are hoisted, but they are not initialized until the line where they are declared. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

7. **Answer: B) Creates a new function with a specified `this` context.**
   - Explanation: The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when invoked, has its `this` set to the provided `thisArg`.

8. **Answer: A) `concat()`**
   - Explanation: `concat()` is used to merge two or more arrays into a new array.

9. **Answer: A) `'number'`**
   - Explanation: `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not-A-Number" and has the type `'number'`.

10. **Answer: B) `this` inside a regular function refers to the object that called the function.**
    - Explanation: In regular functions, `this` refers to the object that calls the function. In strict mode, `this` refers to `undefined`.

## Section C: Conceptual JavaScript Questions

11. **Answer:**
    - **Closures in JavaScript**:
      A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures allow functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created, even after the outer function has finished executing.
      Example:
      ```javascript
      function outer() {
        let count = 0;
        return function inner() {
          count++;
          console.log(count);
        };
      }
      
      const counter = outer();
      counter(); // 1
      counter(); // 2
      ```

12. **Answer:**
    - **Event Delegation**:
      Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where events are attached to a parent element, and the event's propagation is used to handle events for child elements. It is useful because it minimizes the number of event listeners and improves performance, especially when handling dynamic content.

      Example:
      ```javascript
      document.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        if (event.target && event.target.matches('button.className')) {
          console.log('Button clicked!');
        }
      });
      ```

13. **Answer:**
    - **Difference Between `==` and `===`**:
      - `==` is the loose equality operator and compares values after performing type coercion (e.g., `0 == '0'` is `true`).
      - `===` is the strict equality operator and compares both value and type (e.g., `0 === '0'` is `false`).
      - Use `===` when you want strict equality.

14. **Answer:**
    - **Promises in JavaScript**:
      Promises represent a value that may be available now or in the future. They improve asynchronous programming by providing a cleaner, more readable way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises can be chained with `.then()` and handle errors with `.catch()`.
      
      Example:
      ```javascript
      let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let success = true;
        if(success) {
          resolve('Data fetched');
        } else {
          reject('Error');
        }
      });

      promise.then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.log(error));
      ```

15. **Answer:**
    - **Prototype in JavaScript**:
      The prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties. Prototypal inheritance allows objects to share properties and methods. Unlike classical inheritance (used in languages like Java), JavaScript objects are linked to other objects, not classes.

## Section D: Frequently Asked Polyfill Questions

16. **Answer:**
    - **Polyfill for `Array.prototype.map()`**:
      ```javascript
      if (!Array.prototype.map) {
        Array.prototype.map = function(func, thisArg) {
          if (this == null) {
            throw new TypeError('Cannot read property "map" of null or undefined');
          }
          
          const arr = Object(this);
          const len = arr.length >>> 0;
          const result = [];
          for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (i in arr) {
              result[i] = func.call(thisArg, arr[i], i, arr);
            }
          }
          return result;
        };
      }
      ```

17. **Answer:**
    - **Polyfill for `Function.prototype.bind()`**:
      ```javascript
      if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
        Function.prototype.bind = function(thisArg, ...args) {
          if (typeof this !== 'function') {
            throw new TypeError('Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable');
          }
          
          const originalFunc = this;
          return function(...innerArgs) {
            return originalFunc.apply(thisArg, [...args, ...innerArgs]);
          };
        };
      }
      ```

18. **Answer:**
    - **Polyfill for `Object.create()`**:
      ```javascript
      if (!Object.create) {
        Object.create = function(proto, propertiesObject) {
          if (proto !== null && typeof proto !== 'object' && typeof proto !== 'function') {
            throw new TypeError('The prototype must be an object or null');
          }

          function F() {}
          F.prototype = proto;
          const obj = new F();
          
          if (propertiesObject !== undefined) {
            Object.defineProperties(obj, propertiesObject);
          }
          return obj;
        };
      }
      ```
