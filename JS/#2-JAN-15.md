## Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (10 Questions)

**Topics: Promises, Arrays, Closures, Objects**

1. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     a: 10,
     b: () => {
       console.log(this.a);
     },
   };
   obj.b();
   ```

   a) 10  
   b) undefined  
   c) null  
   d) Throws an error

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   b) undefined

   **Explanation:**
   In JavaScript, arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. They inherit the `this` value from the surrounding lexical scope at the time they are defined.

   In the provided code, the arrow function `b` does not have its own `this`, and since it is invoked as `obj.b()`, `this` inside the arrow function refers to the global context (i.e., `window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js).

   Since `this.a` refers to `a` in the global context (which is not defined), `console.log(this.a)` will print `undefined`.

2. **Given the following code, what will be logged to the console?**

   ```javascript
   let count = 0;
   (function immediate() {
     if (count === 0) {
       let count = 1;
       console.log(count);
     }
     console.log(count);
   })();
   ```

   a) 1 and 0  
   b) 1 and 1  
   c) 0 and 1  
   d) 0 and 0

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) 1 and 0**

   **Explanation:**
   In the given code, there are two different variables named `count`. The first one is declared in the outer scope with the value `0`, and the second one is declared inside the `if` block using the `let` keyword with the value `1`. This inner `count` is local to the block and does not affect the outer `count`.

   - The first `console.log(count)` inside the `if` block logs `1` because the inner `count` is `1`.
   - The second `console.log(count)` logs `0` because it refers to the outer `count` which was initialized to `0` and remains unchanged after the inner block.

</details>

3. **What is the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const array = [1, 2, 3];
   array[10] = 99;
   console.log(array.length);
   ```

   a) 3  
   b) 10  
   c) 11  
   d) 12

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **c) 11**

   **Explanation:**
   In JavaScript, arrays are sparse, meaning you can directly set an element at an arbitrary index, like `array[10] = 99`. However, this doesn't affect the other indices in between.

   - Initially, the array has a length of `3` because there are 3 elements `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - By setting `array[10] = 99`, you effectively add a `99` at index `10`, but no elements are added in between, so the length of the array becomes `11` (since array indices are zero-based and the highest index is `10`).

</details>

4. **Consider the following code:**

   ```javascript
   function createIncrement() {
     let count = 0;
     function increment() {
       count++;
     }
     let message = `Count is ${count}`;
     function log() {
       console.log(message);
     }
     return [increment, log];
   }
   const [increment, log] = createIncrement();
   increment();
   increment();
   increment();
   log();
   ```

   What does the `log` function output when called?

   a) Count is 0  
   b) Count is 1  
   c) Count is 2  
   d) Count is 3

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **d) Count is 3**

   **Explanation:**

   - The `createIncrement` function defines a local variable `count` initialized to `0` and two inner functions, `increment` and `log`.
   - The `increment` function increments `count` each time it is called. Since it is invoked three times, `count` becomes `3`.
   - The `message` variable is created with the initial value of `count` (which is `0`), and then the `log` function logs this message.
   - Since `message` was set before any increment calls, it retains its value of `Count is 0` when the `log` function is executed.

</details>

5. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     console.log(1);
     resolve();
     console.log(2);
   });
   promise.then(() => {
     console.log(3);
   });
   console.log(4);
   ```

   - a) 1 2 3 4
   - b) 1 2 4 3
   - c) 1 4 2 3
   - d) 4 1 2 3

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    **b) 1 2 4 3**

   **Explanation:**

   - Promise Creation: When you create a new promise with new Promise(), the promise constructor immediately executes the function you provide to it (the executor function). This function is run synchronously when the promise is created.
   - Executor Function Execution: The executor function ((resolve, reject) => {...}) is the callback function that the Promise constructor automatically calls right away. It doesn't need to be invoked explicitly by you.

   - As soon as new Promise() is encountered, JavaScript runs the code inside the executor function. In your case, this executor function logs 1, calls resolve(), and then logs 2.
     Promise Resolution: Calling resolve() inside the executor function will mark the promise as "resolved," but the handler (like .then()) is not executed until the synchronous code finishes. However, the execution of the executor function happens immediately during the creation of the promise.

   - The code executes in the following order:
     1.  `console.log(1)` is called, so `1` is printed.
     2.  The promise is created, but the `resolve` function does not execute immediately. The remaining synchronous code in the executor runs, so `console.log(2)` is called, printing `2`.
     3.  The promise is resolved, and the `then` callback is scheduled to run, but it is added to the microtask queue, which gets processed after the synchronous code finishes.
     4.  `console.log(4)` is called, printing `4` before the promise callback is executed.
     5.  Finally, the promise `then` callback runs and prints `3`.

6. **What does the following code output?**

   ```javascript
   const person = {
     name: "Alice",
     greet() {
       console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
     },
   };
   const greet = person.greet;
   greet();
   ```

   - a) Hello, Alice
   - b) Hello, undefined
   - c) Hello,
   - d) Throws an error

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **b) Hello, undefined**

   **Explanation:**
   - The code creates a method `greet` on the `person` object, but when calling `greet()` directly (without `person`), the value of `this` is not bound to the `person` object.
   - In JavaScript, when a function is invoked in this way (not as a method of an object), the value of `this` is `undefined` in strict mode or the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers) in non-strict mode.
   - Since `this` is `undefined` or the global object, `this.name` is not defined, resulting in `undefined` being logged.

7. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     a: 1,
     b: {
       c: 2,
       d: 3,
     },
   };
   const {
     a,
     b: { c, d },
   } = obj;
   console.log(a, c, d);
   ```

   - a) 1 2 3
   - b) 1 {c: 2, d: 3}
   - c) undefined 2 3
   - d) Throws an error

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) 1 2 3**

   **Explanation:**
   - The code demonstrates object destructuring in JavaScript. It extracts the values of `a`, `c`, and `d` from the `obj` object.
   - The object `obj` has a property `a` with a value of `1`, and a nested object `b` with properties `c` and `d` having values `2` and `3` respectively.
   - The destructuring statement:
     ```javascript
     const { a, b: { c, d } } = obj;
     ```
     extracts `a` from `obj`, and destructures the nested object `b` to extract `c` and `d`.
   - Therefore, when `console.log(a, c, d)` is executed, it prints the values `1 2 3`.

  </details>


8. **Consider the following code:**

   ```javascript
   function outer() {
     let count = 0;
     return function inner() {
       count++;
       console.log(count);
     };
   }
   const counter = outer();
   counter();
   counter();
   ```

   What is the output of the two counter() calls?

   - a) 1 and 1
   - b) 1 and 2
   - c) 2 and 2
   - d) undefined and undefined

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **b) 1 and 2**

   **Explanation:**
   - This code demonstrates the concept of closures in JavaScript. 
   - The function `outer` defines a local variable `count` and returns the `inner` function, which has access to the `count` variable due to the closure.
   - When `outer()` is called, it returns the `inner` function and assigns it to the `counter` variable.
   - On calling `counter()` the first time, `count` is incremented from `0` to `1` and logged.
   - On calling `counter()` the second time, `count` is incremented from `1` to `2` and logged.
   - Since the `inner` function retains the lexical scope of `outer`, the value of `count` persists between calls to `counter()`.

   Therefore, the output will be: 1 and 2
   </details>


9. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     a: 1,
     b: function () {
       return this.a + 1;
     },
   };
   const b = obj.b;
   console.log(b());
   ```

   - a) 2
   - b) NaN
   - c) undefined
   - d) Throws an error

   <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>
      b) NaN

      **Explanation:**
      - The function `obj.b` is a method within the `obj` object and correctly uses `this.a` to access the property `a` within the object.
      - However, when `const b = obj.b;` is executed, it extracts the function `b` from the `obj` object. Now, the `this` value within the function `b()` no longer refers to the `obj` object. Instead, it refers to the global context (or `undefined` in strict mode).
      - Since `this.a` refers to `undefined` when `b()` is called outside of the `obj` context, the expression `undefined + 1` results in `NaN`.

   </details>

10. **What does the following code output?**

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
    const newArr = arr.map((num) => {
      if (typeof num === "number") return;
      return num * 2;
    });
    console.log(newArr);
    ```

    - a) [undefined, undefined, undefined]
    - b) [null, null, null]
    - c) [1, 2, 3]
    - d) [empty × 3]

    <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>
      **a) [undefined, undefined, undefined]**

    **Explanation:**
      - The `map` function iterates over each element of the array `arr`.
      - In this case, for each element, the condition `typeof num === "number"` is true, so the `return` statement executes and returns `undefined` (because no value is explicitly returned).
      - As a result, for each element in the array, `undefined` is added to the new array, resulting in `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`.

# Section B: Multiple Answer Questions (10 Questions)

**Topics: Core JavaScript Concepts, Web APIs, OOP in JavaScript**

1. **Which of the following are true about JavaScript's this keyword?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) this refers to the object from which it was called.
   - b) In arrow functions, this is lexically bound.
   - c) this can be explicitly set using call, apply, or bind.
   - d) this always refers to the global object.

   <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>
      **a) this refers to the object from which it was called.** </br> 
      **b) In arrow functions, this is lexically bound.** </br>  
      **c) this can be explicitly set using call, apply, or bind.** </br>  

      **Explanation:**
      - **a)** This is correct because in regular functions, `this` refers to the object from which the function was called, but its value depends on the invocation context.
      - **b)** In arrow functions, `this` is lexically bound, meaning it doesn't have its own `this`. Instead, it inherits `this` from the enclosing scope.
      - **c)** `this` can be explicitly set in functions using `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`. These methods allow you to specify the `this` value when calling a function.
      - **d)** This is incorrect because `this` does not always refer to the global object. The value of `this` depends on how the function is called.
  </details>


2. **Which of the following are valid ways to create an object in JavaScript?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) Using object literal syntax.
   - b) Using the new Object() syntax.
   - c) Using a constructor function.
   - d) Using the Object.create() method.

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) Using object literal syntax.**  
   **b) Using the new Object() syntax.**  
   **c) Using a constructor function.**  
   **d) Using the Object.create() method.**  

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** This is correct because object literal syntax `{}` is the most common and simplest way to create objects.
   - **b)** This is correct. You can create an object using the `new Object()` syntax, although it is less commonly used compared to object literals.
   - **c)** This is correct. You can use a constructor function to create objects. The function is called with the `new` keyword to create a new object.
   - **d)** This is correct. `Object.create()` is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.
   </details>


3. **Which of the following are true about JavaScript Promises?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
   - b) The then method returns a new promise.
   - c) Promises are synchronous by nature.
   - d) The catch method is used to handle promise rejections.

   <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    **a) A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.**  
    **b) The then method returns a new promise.**  
    **d) The catch method is used to handle promise rejections.**  

    **Explanation:**
    - **a)** This is correct. A promise can be in one of three states: *pending* (initial state), *fulfilled* (resolved successfully), or *rejected* (error occurred).
    - **b)** This is correct. The `then` method returns a new promise, allowing for promise chaining.
    - **d)** This is correct. The `catch` method is used to handle promise rejections or errors in a promise chain.
    - **c)** This is incorrect. Promises are asynchronous, not synchronous. They allow you to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data without blocking the execution of the rest of the code.
  </details>


4. **Which of the following are Web APIs provided by browsers?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) fetch
   - b) localStorage
   - c) setTimeout
   - d) JSON.parse

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) fetch**  
   **b) localStorage**  
   **c) setTimeout**  

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** The `fetch` API is a Web API provided by browsers for making HTTP requests.
   - **b)** The `localStorage` API allows browsers to store key-value pairs locally in a user's browser.
   - **c)** The `setTimeout` method is part of the browser's Web API and allows delaying the execution of a function.
   - **d)** This is incorrect. `JSON.parse` is not a Web API; it is a core JavaScript function provided by the language itself to parse JSON strings into JavaScript objects.
</details>


5. **Which of the following are true about JavaScript closures?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope.
   - b) Closures are created every time a function is invoked.
   - c) Closures can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.
   - d) Closures restrict access to variables from outer scopes.

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope.**  
   **b) Closures are created every time a function is invoked.**  
   **c) Closures can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.**  

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** Correct. Closures are a fundamental feature of JavaScript that enable functions to "remember" variables from their defining scope, even after that scope has exited.
   - **b)** Correct. Each invocation of a function creates a new closure that encapsulates its own set of variables.
   - **c)** Correct. Closures can lead to memory leaks if references to them persist unnecessarily, preventing garbage collection.
   - **d)** Incorrect. Closures do not restrict access to variables from outer scopes; they provide access to them.
</details>


6. **Which of the following are characteristics of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.
   - b) Classes are the primary means of creating inheritance hierarchies.
   - c) Functions can have prototype properties that are shared among instances.
   - d) Inheritance is established through the extends keyword.

  <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.**  
   **c) Functions can have prototype properties that are shared among instances.**  

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** Correct. In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects through the prototype chain.
   - **b)** Incorrect. JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, not class-based inheritance. Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.
   - **c)** Correct. Functions in JavaScript have a prototype property that allows properties and methods to be shared across instances created by the function when used as a constructor.
   - **d)** Incorrect. While the `extends` keyword is used in ES6+ for class inheritance, JavaScript's core inheritance mechanism is prototype-based, not class-based.
</details>


7. **Which of the following statements are true about the async and await keywords in JavaScript?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) async functions always return a promise.
   - b) await can only be used inside async functions.
   - c) await pauses the execution of the function until the awaited promise resolves.
   - d) async functions execute synchronously until the first await is encountered.

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) async functions always return a promise.**  
   **b) await can only be used inside async functions.**  
   **c) await pauses the execution of the function until the awaited promise resolves.**  
   **d) async functions execute synchronously until the first await is encountered.**

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** Correct. The `async` keyword ensures that a function always returns a promise, even if no explicit promise is returned in the function body.
   - **b)** Correct. The `await` keyword can only be used within an `async` function to ensure proper syntax and behavior.
   - **c)** Correct. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the async function until the promise it is waiting for is resolved.
   - **d)** Correct. The code inside an `async` function executes synchronously up to the first `await` statement. After encountering `await`, the function's execution is paused until the awaited promise is resolved.
</details>


8. **Which of the following are methods available on JavaScript arrays?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) map
   - b) filter
   - c) reduce
   - d) assign

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) map**  
   **b) filter**  
   **c) reduce**

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** Correct. `map` is a method available on arrays that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
   - **b)** Correct. `filter` is a method available on arrays that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
   - **c)** Correct. `reduce` is a method available on arrays that applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.
   - **d)** Incorrect. `assign` is not a method on arrays; it is a method on the `Object` object (`Object.assign`).
</details>


9. **Which of the following are true about JavaScript's event loop?** (Select all that apply)

   - a) It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations.
   - b) It manages the execution of multiple threads.
   - c) It processes events and executes callback functions.
   - d) It is part of the JavaScript runtime environment.

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   **a) It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations.**  
   **c) It processes events and executes callback functions.**  
   **d) It is part of the JavaScript runtime environment.**

   **Explanation:**
   - **a)** Correct. The event loop enables JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations (e.g., timers, I/O operations) without blocking the main thread.
   - **b)** Incorrect. JavaScript is single-threaded. The event loop does not manage multiple threads but handles tasks from the callback queue.
   - **c)** Correct. The event loop processes tasks from the queue, such as I/O operations and timers, and executes their callbacks.
   - **d)** Correct. The event loop is a fundamental component of the JavaScript runtime environment, ensuring non-blocking behavior.

      **Closures in JavaScript:**
      
      A **closure** is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's variables, and the global variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures allow functions to remember the environment in which they were created, thus providing a way to create **private variables**.

      **How Closures Work:**
      - A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function retains access to the outer function's variables.
      - This allows the inner function to "remember" the scope of the outer function even after it has returned.

      **Example of Using Closures to Create Private Variables:**
      
      In this example, we use a closure to create a private variable `count` that is not directly accessible from outside the function. The `increment` function can modify `count`, but the `count` itself is not directly exposed.

      ```javascript
      function createCounter() {
        let count = 0; // Private variable

        // Inner function (closure) that has access to the outer function's variables
        function increment() {
          count++;
          console.log(count);
        }

        // Returning the increment function as a closure
        return increment;
      }

      // Create a counter with its own private `count`
      const counter = createCounter();

      counter(); // Output: 1
      counter(); // Output: 2
      counter(); // Output: 3
      ```
      
      **Explanation:**

      The count variable is encapsulated inside the createCounter function, and it cannot be accessed directly from the outside.
      The increment function, which forms a closure, has access to the count variable.
      Each call to counter() increases the private count variable and logs its value.
      Benefits of Closures:

      - Encapsulation: Closures help in creating private data or variables that cannot be modified directly from outside.
      - State Persistence: The inner function "remembers" the state of the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

2. **Describe the event loop in JavaScript. How does it handle asynchronous operations, and what role does the call stack and task queue play in this process?**

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **Event Loop in JavaScript:**

   The **event loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner, even though JavaScript itself is single-threaded. It enables the execution of code, event handling, and asynchronous callbacks in a specific order.

   **How the Event Loop Works:**

   1. **Call Stack**:
      - The **call stack** is a data structure that keeps track of function execution. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the stack. When the function finishes executing, it is removed from the stack.
      - JavaScript executes one operation at a time in a synchronous manner. If a function is executing, any other function must wait in the stack until it finishes.

   2. **Task Queue**:
      - The **task queue** (also called the **callback queue** or **message queue**) stores asynchronous operations or events, such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, and event handlers.
      - When an asynchronous operation is completed, its associated callback function is added to the task queue.

   3. **Event Loop**:
      - The **event loop** continuously monitors both the call stack and the task queue.
      - It first checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, the event loop will push the first callback from the task queue onto the call stack to be executed.
      - The event loop keeps repeating this process, ensuring that asynchronous callbacks are executed only when the call stack is empty.

   **Handling Asynchronous Operations:**

   When an asynchronous operation (like an API request or a timer) is triggered, its callback function is not executed immediately. Instead:
   - The operation starts executing.
   - When it finishes, its callback function is placed in the task queue.
   - The event loop picks it up from the task queue once the call stack is clear (i.e., all currently executing functions have finished).

   **Process Overview:**
   - JavaScript code is executed in the **call stack**.
   - Asynchronous operations are offloaded to the **Web APIs** (like timers, network requests, etc.).
   - Once the asynchronous operation finishes, its callback is moved to the **task queue**.
   - The event loop checks if the call stack is empty and then moves the callback from the task queue to the call stack.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Start');  // 1

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('Callback');  // 4
   }, 1000);

   console.log('End');  // 2
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `console.log('Start')` statement is added to the call stack and executed immediately.
   - The `setTimeout` function is called, and its callback is added to the task queue.
   - The `console.log('End')` statement is added to the call stack and executed immediately.
   - The event loop checks the call stack and task queue. Since the call stack is empty, it moves the callback from the task queue to the call stack.
   - The callback is executed, and `console.log('Callback')` is added to the console.

   **Call Stack and Task Queue Role:**

   - Call Stack: Executes synchronous code one step at a time.
   - Task Queue: Holds asynchronous callbacks that are executed once the call stack is empty.
    Event Loop: Manages the flow of the call stack and the task queue, ensuring asynchronous code is executed at the right time.
    Key Points:

    JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning only one operation can be executed at a time.
    Asynchronous operations are offloaded to the task queue, and their callbacks are executed when the call stack is empty.
    The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

4. **What are JavaScript Promises? Explain their states and how they can be used to handle asynchronous operations. Provide an example of chaining multiple promises.**

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>

   **JavaScript Promises:**

   A **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises allow handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and structured way than traditional callback-based methods, helping to avoid "callback hell."

   **States of a Promise:**

   A Promise can be in one of the following three states:

   1. **Pending**: The initial state. The Promise is neither resolved nor rejected, and the asynchronous operation is still ongoing.
   2. **Fulfilled**: The operation has completed successfully, and the Promise has a resulting value (which can be accessed using the `then()` method).
   3. **Rejected**: The operation has failed, and the Promise has a reason for the failure (which can be handled using the `catch()` method).

   **Creating and Handling Promises:**

   When a Promise is created, it takes a function (called the **executor**) that receives two functions: `resolve` and `reject`.

   - `resolve(value)`: Called when the operation is successful, and the Promise is fulfilled with a `value`.
   - `reject(reason)`: Called when the operation fails, and the Promise is rejected with a `reason`.

   **Example of Creating and Handling a Promise:**

   ```javascript
   const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     const success = true;
     
     if (success) {
       resolve('Operation was successful');
     } else {
       reject('Operation failed');
     }
   });

   myPromise
     .then((message) => {
       console.log(message);  // 'Operation was successful'
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.log(error);  // Will not be triggered in this case
     });
   ```
